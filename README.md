# ruby-hurst-portfolio
Hello and welcome to my portfolio.

Here is a repository for my portfolio I will be creating and updating throughout my course.

The goal is to build a website with easy access to my own applications I've created for future employers to review, in the hopes of
getting a job wherever I apply in the future.
It will be broken down into sections:
 - Name, picture of me, links that lead to information about myself, ways to contact me.
 - Individual box sections of my created applications.
 - And of course styling and functioning links.

Substitutes will have to be created in place of the application sections, based on where exactly I am up to in my course and how many appplications I've actually created. Again, this will be updated over time of course. "Coming Soon" examples  may be  used in place of empty application sections.
