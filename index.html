    <div class="about-me">
        <p>
            From waitressing, to assistant in nursing, to being a hardware technician, I'm taking my next big step in my career path with Web Development. I've been passionate about 
            coding since I was in high school with my teacher at the time being one of my biggest influences, always pushing me to pursue what I love. However, I didn't have a very good 
            experience with high school just like many other Australian teenagers. I didn't know exactly what I REALLY wanted to do, and it wouldn't be until another six years later 
            where I would even build any self confidence.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            I waitressed for three years whilst I studied, going from nursing in acute care and graduating with great grades and a job opportunity, to changing my mind and studying in
            hardware and networking technology. Here I received another job opportunity and have been working there as a hardware technician ever since. It's a good job, I work on 
            iPhones, laptops, desktops (both commercial and consumer) and I work in a great team. But as time went on I became used to the job quickly and my old teacher's voice came 
            to mind, reminding me what I really should be and want to be pursuing.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Here I am learning Web Development and loving every exhausting late night of it. And I'm proud of myself for it, I know I have a lot of work ahead of me. All of which
            I hope will present itself through this portfolio of mine as I produce my works here and what I'm capable of. Nothing speaks louder than actions after all. 
        </p>

            Welcome to my portfolio.
